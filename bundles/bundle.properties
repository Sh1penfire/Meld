status.meld-liquid-logistics.name = [accent]Liquid Logistics[]
status.meld-liquid-logistics.description = Schematics for a basic [accent]liquid distribution network[] and an [#cb8650]Aether[] source.\nThe network is comprised of four components.\n\n\n-[accent]Channel Nodes[] which form the corners and outlets of the network\n-[accent]Channel Faces[] which connect parts of the network.\n-[accent]Channel Directors[] which control the direction and pressure of fluids\n-[accent]Aspect Outlets[] which serve as the endpoint for [#cb8650]Aether[] networks.\n\nChannels can be walked on freely and are stable enough to be placed on deep patches of liquid. The Backdrop will [red]not[] support Channels.

status.meld-murk-handling.name = [accent]Murk Handling[]
status.meld-murk-handling.description = The Mercury Swamp has proven to be quite hostile in numerous ways, but bessides the outright hostile threats, there have been issues reguarding excess Starving Masses and fluid filtration...\n\nTheese schematics detail a number of ways to handle this, ranging from [accent]Compartmentalized Nodes[], [accent]Filtration Units[], [accent]Neutralization/Purification Chambers[].\n\n[accent]Pressurized Dispersion[] would be helpful to control any accidents.

status.meld-pressure-control.name = [accent]Pressure Control[]

Any attempts to shoot Fluids out into the world only created puddles.\n\nWith advances in [accent]Pressure Control[] combined with observations about the Mercury Swamp's flora, fluids can now be dispersed into the world with more control over longer distances.\n\n[red]Further advances in technology are required to bridge gaps inside Channel networks or to utalize solid atomized jets.[]\n\n[accent]Murk Handling[] is greatly helpful to filter out fluids for use by Fluid Sprayers.

status.meld-fluid-extraction.name = [accent]Fluid Extraction[]

status.meld-fissure-tapping.details = Ikaruian vents have strange properties. Most vents emit fumes which are key in a number of different processes, but the main two are creating a concrete substitute and synthesizing carbolith in times of deficit.\n\nCertain vents run with [#e6c700]Ichor[] emitting coloured sparkles alongside the regular dull brown smoke swirls.

status.meld-building-foundations.name = Building Foundations
status.meld-building-foundations.description = For too long structures have been made with Debris and Carbolith as foundations, only using refined materials for moving parts...\n\nWith new data about [#e6c700]Ichor[]'s properties, and observations about how [#ea9ad6]Meld[] constructs form their shells, a new way to industrially cement Carbolith dust into mock Carbon Stone has been prototyped and is ready to deploy.\n\n[accent]Brick Conglomerators and Earthen Crushers[] produce the bricks and motar for building foundations with a variety of materials and deposits, allowing certain buildings to take on some natural [accent]armor[] and be built far quicker.\n\n[accent]Boulders are a good source of Bricks/Gloop and will return some when deconstructed.[]

status.meld-aspect-channeling.details = Aspect was deemed too dangerous to be converted into power en-mass, but there is rumor of an entry heavly encrypted which allowed for this type of conversion.\n\nThe Temple guarding this secret was to be hidden away from Strata, hidden from you, but there is still hope that it hasn't completely sunken into the backdrop...

status.meld-power-transmission.name = [accent]Power Transmission[]
status.meld-power-transmission.description = Schematics for buildings which use Electrum to focus power into lasers, allowing transmission without physical connection. This entry is comprised of three buildings.\n\n-[accent]Connectors[] are a stock standard power node which use Stony Gloop & Compacted Bricks as compared to more abundant materials, allowing them to be built quickly.\n-[accent]Substations[] are able to both connect over longer distances (but to fewer targets) and store small amounts of power.\n-[accent]Continental Links[] are able to bridge large sections of the sector in a cardinal direction, and can withstand a large amount of damage.\n\n[#8166f0]More observation may be required to fully defragment this entry's buildings.[]
