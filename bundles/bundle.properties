The Backdrop will [red]not[] support Channels.

status.meld-murk-handling.name = [accent]Murk Handling[]
status.meld-murk-handling.description = The Mercury Swamp has proven to be quite hostile in numerous ways, but bessides the outright hostile threats, there have been issues reguarding excess Starving Masses and fluid filtration...\n\nTheese schematics detail a number of ways to handle this, ranging from [accent]Compartmentalized Nodes[], [accent]Filtration Units[], [accent]Neutralization/Purification Chambers[].\n\n[accent]Pressurized Dispersion[] would be helpful to control any accidents.

status.meld-pressure-control.name = [accent]Pressure Control[]

status.meld-pressurized-dispersion.name = [accent]Pressurized Dispersion[]
status.meld-pressurized-dispersion.description = Getting fluids from point A to B was previously only possible with Channels. Any attempts to shoot Fluids out into the world only created puddles.\n\nWith advances in [accent]Pressure Control[] combined with observations about the Mercury Swamp's flora, fluids can now be dispersed into the world with more control over longer distances.\n\n[red]Further advances in technology are required to bridge gaps inside Channel networks or to utalize solid atomized jets.[]\n\n[accent]Murk Handling[] is greatly helpful to filter out fluids for use by Fluid Sprayers.

status.meld-aspect-channeling.details = Aspect was deemed too dangerous to be converted into power en-mass, but there is rumor of an entry heavly encrypted which allowed for this type of conversion.\n\nThe Temple guarding this secret was to be hidden away from Strata, hidden from you, but there is still hope that it hasn't completely sunken into the backdrop...

status.meld-power-transmission.name = [accent]Power Transmission[]
status.meld-power-transmission.description = Schematics for buildings which use Electrum to focus power into lasers, allowing transmission without physical connection. This entry is comprised of three buildings.\n\n-[accent]Connectors[] are a stock standard power node which use Stony Gloop & Compacted Bricks as compared to more abundant materials, allowing them to be built quickly.\n-[accent]Substations[] are able to both connect over longer distances (but to fewer targets) and store small amounts of power.\n-[accent]Continental Links[] are able to bridge large sections of the sector in a cardinal direction, and can withstand a large amount of damage.
